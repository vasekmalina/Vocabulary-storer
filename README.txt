open vocb_record.py to record words
	highlight word with mouse and press "s"
	or you can press "w" in script and write a word by yourself
	when you want to quit, press "e" but bear in mind that excel has to be closed 
	or script raises an exception and you lose everything you entered in

open vocab_manage.py to move words from input to main
	during this process, script will search for words that are already in main sheet
	

open voc_repeat_check.py if you want to check whether there are any words stored more than once
	this should be handled in other scripts, but it doesn't work quite right
